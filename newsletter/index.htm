              <p align="left" class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left" class="style1">The Wizard of Oz </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green.  They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid.  The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">&quot;This must be the Land of Oz,&quot; said Dorothy, &quot;and we are surely getting near the Emerald City.&quot;</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the Scarecrow.  &quot;Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color.  But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.&quot;</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Around the World in 80 Days </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado.  They entered Nebraska at eleven, passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the southern branch of the Platte River.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge.  Two powerful locomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point; cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train.  Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist.  The whistle of the locomotive, more powerful than Amphion's lyre, was about to bid them rise from American soil.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style2">Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha.  The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River, on its left bank.  At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte, built between the two arms of the river, which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery, a large tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha.</p></td>
